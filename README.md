# Dog-breed-project
This is my project on prediction of dog breed
We were provided with a training set and a test set of images of dogs. Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 120 breeds of dogs. The goal is to create a classifier capable of determining a dog's breed from a photo.

# These are some of my prediction from the project
